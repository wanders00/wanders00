### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a 3rd year student, studying Software Engineering and Management (SEM), at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), a joint department between Chalmers University of Technology and University of Gothenburg.

On my profile you can find projects from my studies and random stuff I've done on my own time.
